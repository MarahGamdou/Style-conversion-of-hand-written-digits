# Style conversion of hand written digits

Style conversion of hand-written digits using a variational autoencoder. The objective is to have a disentangled representation (to separate the  identity of the digit from its style in the latent vector)

ðŸ’¡ The idea is to start from an entangled representation as shown in the first figure and transform it into a disentangled representation as shown in the second one, to perform a style conversion (the handwriting style) while keeping the identity of the digit (the number).
